# Materials
All materials for student's to pull each day when they arrive in class

# Student One Time Setup
1. Open Terminal
2. Run the code git clone 'https://github.com/KSantos1995/materials.git' in your terminal to download all materials locally
3. Create a folder where you will do your work with 'mkdir -p ~/my_work'

# Student Daily Workflow
1. Change directory in terminal to materials directory 'cd materials/'
2. Grab most recent changes with 'git pull' then 'cd ..' to go back to a scope where you can see both directories.
3. Copy specific file or directory to your work folder with 'cp materials/specific_file_or_folder my_work'
4. When done working make sure to 'git push origin main' to save all of your work in your github repo. This is where I will track your submitted work.
